## [JS] Speckle Core Receiver Client for Node apps
This is a simple nodejs client that normalises interaction with a Speckle Server.

See `example.js` for some basic functionality (run `npm start`). 

So far tested against `node 4.4.3`. 

### Note: The Speckle Family
Speckle is a decentralised platform for design data communication. What does this mean? Well, Speckle sends, syncs and stores geometry and any associated metadata between various clients. We currently have .NET (sender & receiver), nodejs (receiver only) and browser (receiver only) implementations.
